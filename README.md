# Zomato Project
This project analyzes a dataset from Zomato to gain insights into restaurant ratings, types, and costs.
The analysis begins with importing essential libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, followed by a function that cleans the rate column by converting rating strings into float values.
Various visualizations are created, including a count plot for restaurant types, a line plot illustrating the total votes per restaurant type, and a histogram to show the distribution of ratings.
Additionally, a count plot is used to explore the distribution of approximate costs for two people.
A box plot visualizes the relationship between online ordering availability and restaurant ratings, while a heatmap reveals the interaction between restaurant types and online ordering options.
Each visualization helps to uncover patterns and insights, making the dataset more comprehensible.
